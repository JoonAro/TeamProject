# Teamproject

This is a team project to test out github commands and collaborating on a project.

## How it works

- First, create a repository.
- Add collaborators
- Every collaborator clones the repo
- Create separate branches
- Make changes independently
- Push to own branch
- Create pull request to main
- Merge to main
- Delete branch.
